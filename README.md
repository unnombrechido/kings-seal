# Prior Art Disclosure and Idea Timestamp Record  
**Hybrid Layered Trust System for QR Code Scanning**

## Purpose of This Document
This document serves as a **public disclosure** of my original invention to establish myself as the originator and to create prior art. By publishing or archiving this dated description, I prevent others from patenting the same idea in the future. This is not a patent application — it is simply a clear, timestamped record of the idea.

## Simple Explanation (For Everyone)
QR codes today are like unmarked envelopes — anyone can make one, and your phone often opens the link without enough caution. My invention adds three clear layers of trust to phone QR scanners (built into the camera or apps), inspired by physical mail:

1. **Personal Trust (Your Own Safe List)**  
   You build a personal list of sources you trust. Once added, future QR codes from those sources open smoothly. Adding happens safely — only after successful use (e.g., page loads correctly), and automatically for obvious safe types like Wi-Fi passwords or plain text (no links).

2. **Official Trust (The "Seal")**  
   Verified companies/organizations add a digital "seal" via a registry. Scanners show a clear "Trusted" mark with the sender’s name. This seal is **required** for shortened URLs (tiny.url, bit.ly, etc.) — unsealed shortened-URL QRs get warnings.

3. **Caution for Everything Else**  
   Unverified QRs show a prominent warning with full payload preview before any action.

This protects against phishing (especially shortened URLs) while keeping QR codes accessible for casual use.

## Technical Summary
The system evaluates scanned QR payloads in layers:
- **Local Personal Trust**: User-guided allowlist with safe addition (post-success prompts, auto-add for Wi-Fi/plain-text).
- **Global Verified Issuer**: Mandatory digital seal for shortened URLs; verified via registry signature.
- **Default Caution**: Warnings + preview for all others.

Visual indicators differentiate levels; no one-click trust for risky payloads.

I declare this idea originated with me on or before December 18, 2025.
