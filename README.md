# King’s Seal

**A Hybrid Layered Trust System for Secure QR Code Scanning**

**Inventor:** Omar David Puente Trejo (unnombrechido)  
**Date:** December 18, 2025

This repository serves as public disclosure and prior art for the King’s Seal system — a simple, effective way to make QR codes trustworthy in a world full of phishing and tampering.

### Core Idea
Three layers of trust, inspired by physical mail:

1. **Personal Trust** — Your own safe list of recurring domains you explicitly trust.
2. **Official Seal** — Verified issuers embed a lightweight seal. Mandatory for shortened URLs or token-based links.
3. **Caution** — Everything else gets a clear warning with preview.

No complex crypto for casual use. Strong protection where it matters.
